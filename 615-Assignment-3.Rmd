#It is interesting to see two of our top producers from, big, southern,
#costal states while the other 4 are from the midwest. 

#Looking at prices, we see that the big producers are also among cheapest states.

#The two large states have high rates of deadout colonies. The 4 big producers from the midwest have low loss rates. 

*We pick six states, which have 31 years data, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA , SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTH DAKOTA, MONTANA and MINNESOTA. Accordng to the graph above, we can see the trend about annual value of each state for 31 years.*

*Clearly, NORTH DAKOTA is the only state among these six states, whose yearly value has a upward trend in last 31 years. The other five states decline volatility in year-values.*

#As we can see in the graph, California has the highest loss all the time, but there was a decrease
#from 2016 to 2017. Florida and North Dakota has very close loss in 2015 and the begining of 2016, 
#however, North Dakota has decreased its loss by 35% from 2016 to 2017 and it now has lower loss
#than Florida. We won't be suprised if there is an decrease in the Price of honey and increase in the
#Production of honey in North Dakota in the year of 2016-2017. The other three states have steady 
#low loss comparing with California, Florida and North Dakota.
